🚦✨ Illuminate Your Path with My Traffic Light Project! ✨🚦

Hey, Projectslearner-fam! <br/>
🌟 I'm beyond excited to unveil my latest creation – a fully functional Traffic Light System! 🚗<br/>
💡 Dive into the world of electronics and coding with me as I bring this project to life. <br/>
Here's how it all came together:

🌿 Green Light: Ready, set, go! The green light stays illuminated for 5 seconds, just like the open road.<br/>
⚡ Yellow Light: Slow down and prepare to stop! The yellow light flashes for 2 seconds.<br/>
🛑 Red Light: Halt! The red light commands a stop for 7 seconds, ensuring safety first.<br/>
🔁 Seamless Cycle: The lights transition smoothly, mimicking real-world traffic signals.<br/>

✨ What You'll Need:<br/>

🖥️ Arduino Uno: The brain of the operation.<br/>
⚡ Breadboard & Jumper Wires: Connecting the dots.<br/>
💡 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green): Our traffic signal stars.<br/>
🔌 Resistors: Keeping things safe and sound.<br/>

💡 Why This Project Rocks:<br/>

Educational: Learn about timing sequences and microcontroller control.<br/>
Practical: A mini version of real-world technology.<br/>
Fun: Perfect for DIY enthusiasts and tech lovers.<br/>
